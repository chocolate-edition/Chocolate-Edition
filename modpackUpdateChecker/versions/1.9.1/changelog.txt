# Chocolate Edition 1.9.1 Patch Update (Bestiary+)

*this is a reupload of 1.9.1, now with "waystones teleport pets" removed. if you are updating from a previous version and find you cannot use waystones, **remove the "waystones teleport pets" mod**

## Important note about updating worlds from previous versions!!
due to changing the name in the ModpackUpdateChecker configs, your old worlds will be marked as "incompatible"

**to fix this:** temporarily **remove or disable** the "modpackUpdateChecker" mod. with it removed/disabled, you will be able to **safely load into your world**. once you have loaded into the world at least once, you are safe to **re-add/re-enable the modpackUpdateChecker mod**

**Brand new Bestiary page in the questbook! info on spawn locations of pretty much every mob, and info on boss fights!**

also fixes a bunch of bugs n stuff

## features
- new tetra materials thanks to tetranomicon update!
- add dedicated wiki link to the questbook welcome page
- replace questbook item with the enigmatic eye (right click functions as a questbook, but you now get cool dialogue for some ingame events!)
- award a free inventory connector and storage terminal (read the tips and tricks!)

## Changes
- disable force loaded spawn chunks (should help stop mob spawn caps being reached due to structures at spawn)
- gated maledictus cursium items to stage 3
- set xaeros minimap default size to auto
- set xaero world waypoint render distance to max 256m
- disable xaeroplus auto waystone waypoints in favour of xaero waystone compatibility mod auto waypoints
- update text of some questbook entries
- disable useless enchants (demon slayer, wrath, slayer)
- update recommended memory settings to max 8GB (the pack runs well with 8, and it is known that 10+ can actually cause problems so now regardless of if you have 32+ GB available it will always recommend 8GB allocated)
- fix modpack updates button on the title screen
- no longer require purchase of previous tier for shop items
- disable transmutation table (if you already have one placed itll still work, but you wont be able to craft one or place one down)
- return vanilla shield recipe
- increase drop rate of drowned necromancer gear


## Bug Fixes
- fixed added resourcepacks not being applied
- fix ftb chunks death waypoint appearing
- fix some quests that were uncompletable
- block some problematic mobs from spawning (naturalist snail, rotten creatures mummy, naturalist tortoise, underminer again)
- unblock eye related mobs from spawning pre-expert mode (mutants, sunken city mobs)
- fix expert mode trigger (expert mode is now activated when the first person defeats the wither, no longer from entering the nether or other dimensions)
- fix some broken mob spawns (cockroaches, encrusted, barinasuchus)
- add wildfire crown drops to dungeon mobs wildfires (now both versions of the wildfire drop the fragments)

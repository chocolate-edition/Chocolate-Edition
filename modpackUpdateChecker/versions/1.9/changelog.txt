# Chocolate Edition 1.9: The Spawning Update
**a note about upgrading from previous versions:**
  this version includes an override for the `options.txt` file. this mean that once updated, you will need to redo any cahnges to keybind and general settings that you may have done

  the reason for this is to ensure all changes to things like resourcepacks and new keybinds are properly applied.

  *I promise we will not do this very often!*

  **also,**
  journeymap has been removed and fully replaced with xaeros. if you are upgrading from 1.8.3, xaeros should have already been saving map data in the background, but you will still have to re-create your waypoints. there are some tools that exist to automatically transfer the data, but we have not tested them ourselves so use at your own risk/ your mileage may vary

**Get ready for the long awaited 1.9 update, the Spawning Overhaul**

we have disabled all natural spawns and using tools like Incontrol and SpawnBalanceUtility, meticulously gone through each and every mob to rebalance their spawns, ensuring you should never feel too stuck looking for a specific spawn or finding no mobs at night.

with that being the primary feature of this update, we have also include some other fixes!

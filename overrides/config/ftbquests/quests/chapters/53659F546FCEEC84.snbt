I cannot interact with your plane of existence directly, I am using all our Power to merely talk to you via the Power of your Eyes. I have only come to ask you for help. My realm has been locked away in space for the past 1,000 years, as a result of some gods of the other realms quarreling with mine. This has left us common folk awaiting someone to come open the portal that sealed us here for generations. "

And please don't forget: the more eyes you collect, the more Powerful you become..."

Though they might as well have been gods, because they had the whole package- stubbornness, savagery, and being the ones in charge of a Broken World. And just because I sought to finish what they started, take the responsibility and be the bad guy- to stop the endless suffering- they suddenly grew a conscience. They tried to defy their nature to stop me. I wasn't having it. Where were they when I was weak? No, that world couldn't be fixed."

Forged with the combined power of civilizations, I tried to steal them from the stronghold where they were kept, but they had replaced the gates, and sucked me into this vile place of nothingness. They couldn't even have the honor to fight me head on. No, they had to trap me here, in the farthest reaches of the Universe, break the eyes so that I could never get out, and starve me of Energy. While I constantly tried to break out- it was no use. I hadn't studied the eye's Power, and I thought it was too late."

My freedom, and a new source of power, will now finally transform me back to my True Self and beyond. I will come into your worlds, and free them all- from their power. And after restoring myself to my former glory- I will burn the remaining little devils that put me here to the ground. But, because I've come to respect your lust for Power, and want a fight with honor, I will let you have a final chance to see my power unfold. Throw an Eye and follow the direction it goes in to make your way to one of the gates. The victory will go to who deserves it.\");"

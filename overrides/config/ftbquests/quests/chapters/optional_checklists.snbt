The mixture seems to have been a favorable ground for the formation of Shiny Crystals, gems with regenerative properties, which can only be found inside of nests. The nest is also covered of Endermite Eggs, which will have a chance to weaken and hatch Endermites or Enderblobs when a nearby player isn't sneaking or invisible, making it dangerous to attempt to mine Shiny Gloopstones. Normal eggs can be picked up by a player, but cracked ones will hatch instantly instead. "

# A list of allowed screen shake priorities:
#`effect` for screen shakes created purely for effect (like when a Fire Slash is passing by),
#`player_action` for meaningful actions that the player performs (like using a Blazing Scimitar to create a Fire Slash),
#`weak_mob_action` for actions performed by mobs that are meaningful but not extremely important (like the Mutant Wither Skeleton's basic attack)
#or `strong_mob_action` for important and meaningful actions performed by mobs (like the Mutant Wither Skeleton's strong attack or a mutant intro animation),
# usually set to `effect`, `player_action` and `strong_mob_action`

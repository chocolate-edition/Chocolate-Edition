	#Whether to increase max transfer rate of some mods to the new stack limit/t.
	#E.g. if max stack limit is 1000, it will become 1000 items per tick (where applicable).
	#How this is done will vary for each mod
	#- Modular routers will require more stack upgrades
	#- Pipez does not need this option, it has a config for transfer rate, which you can set to anything
	#- Mekanism also has its own config value, though the logistical sorter has its extract rate increased
	#- Pretty pipes has its extract rate scaled up
	#- XNet can already extract a variable amount, but you will be able to go past 64 to the new maximum stack limit
	#- Cyclic still extracts 1 stack (more than 64 items) per tick, but the size of the stack is adjusted

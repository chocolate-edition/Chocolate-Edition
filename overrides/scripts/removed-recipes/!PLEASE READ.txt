hey if you're here to remove something please remember to put the following at the top of the script (but after the imports):

#priority 1

this makes sure that the recipes are guaranteed to be removed BEFORE any recipes are added, so it doesn't add a recipe first and then immediately remove it lol :)

i had this problem and it took me half an hour to fix.

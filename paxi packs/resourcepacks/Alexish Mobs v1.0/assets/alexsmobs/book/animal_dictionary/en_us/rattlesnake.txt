The Diamondback is a medium sized snake found in deserts and badlands. This reptile is responsible for the majority of snakebite fatalities in these areas. Most of the time, the diamondback is heard, not
seen, since it produces a loud rattle warning sound when a potential predator is nearby. If one gets close enough to a
rattlesnake while it is rattling, the creature will become hostile and use its poisonous bite to defend itself. Diamondbacks
are the sworn enemy of Roadrunners, their most common predator. Diamondback can be bred with any type of meat.

If it is slain, it has a chance to drop its rattle. These rattles can be brewed with Potions of Poison in
order to create a foul, poisonous essence. Brewing this essence with a Cave Centipede Leg can result in the coveted poison resistance potion.

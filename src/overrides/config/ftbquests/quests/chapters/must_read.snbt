Most of the time the eyes in the \"Medium\" section are way more manageable after unlocking the nether, and the eyes in the hard section are much easier when you have at least most of the others. Some hard eyes are locked until later."

Every eye requires a boss to be slain or adventure to be had, on top of many little slice of life things like going to biomes to cultivate animals or find certain flora. The later eyes do really ramp up in \"difficulty\"- but that just means theres more to do to get them. More adventures, more mechanics to explore, more to build.. more minecraft. Go easy on yourself and enjoy the slow burn!"]

# The Chocolatey Flavour Datapack!
Flavour with a u because I am a member of the Commonwealth

### Features
- Having too much sugar in your diet no longer gives you hunger (we hate game balance!)
- Queen Bee beehives now spawn in jungle (we hate the ecosystem!)
- More beacon base blocks and payment items (we hate cheap beacons!)
- Bosses despawn automatically (we hate overstaying!)
- More to come! (we hate sneak peeks!)
